    In the last article we learned about Svelte stores and even implemented our own custom store to persist the app's information to Web Storage. We
    also had a look at using the transition directive to implement animations on DOM elements in Svelte.

    We will now learn how to use TypeScript in Svelte applications. First we'll learn what TypeScript is and what benefits it can bring us. Then we'll
    see how to configure our project to work with TypeScript files. Finally we will go over our app and see what modifications we have to make to
    fully take advantage of TypeScript features.
